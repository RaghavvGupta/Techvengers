****PROBLEM****
* In this modern era of technology, the number of vehicles and automobiles on roads have increased at a tremendous rate.

* The traffic management system fails frequently when it could not handle the long queues of traffic jam which could cause accidents.

* Many times due to heavy traffic, the emergency vehicles like ambulance and fire brigade get stuck in traffic and could not reach at the accident/disaster spot on time.

* With the upcoming age of smart vehicles, we need a smart & holistic traffic management system which could handle the traffic problems.


****SOLUTION****


* The system provides wireless communication between the traffic light and the emergency vehicle using radio signals. 



* We place each of these devices at light poles, towards the traffic signal from all the sides. We equip the emergency vehicle and the traffic light itself with a similar sensing device. 



* When an emergency vehicle approaches the crossing, it transmitted the radio signals from it to every sensor mounted on the light poles one after the other. 



* When the sensing device nearest to the traffic light finally receives the signal from its preceding pole, the traffic light changes to green. This facilitates the smooth and quick passage of the emergency vehicle. Arduino in turn will alert the Hospital of emergency using Twilio. 



* The traffic light follows its default pattern once the vehicle crosses it and reaches the nearest pole sensor on the other side of the signal.
